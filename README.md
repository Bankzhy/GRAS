# GRAS
GRAS (Graph Refactoring Assistance System) is an assistant tool that helps developers refactor their code.

## üìñ Introduction  
This project is the implementation of the doctoral dissertation *"Software Refactoring using Graph Deep Learning"*.  
We present the core technical implementations, related papers, as well as the architecture and functionalities of the proposed tool.  

The core code will be gradually released as open source after further refinement.
